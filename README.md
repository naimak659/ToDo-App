# To-Do App

I've developed a To-Do App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project serves as a simple yet effective task management tool.

## Features
- Add and remove tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Persistent storage using local storage

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to GreatStack for their informative tutorials and guidance that inspired and assisted me in building this application.

Feel free to explore the code and test the app!

Thank you,
